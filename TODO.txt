The following are things that are being throught about. Whether they get done or not
will depend upon time and resources.


--  ALL Objects
    --  Check all objects for 32-bit word alignment of all data (MIPS requirement)



--  J1939
    --  Move all System/CAN dependent routines here. So, that they can be
        initialized before starting the system.
    --  Merge in CAM ????

--  J1939ecu - ECU
    --  What should go in this?????

--  J1939ca - CA
    --  Make sure time handling is consistant with CA, DG, ER and TC
    --  Look at time rollover in message handlers and timed msgs

--  J1939dg - Diagnostics
    --  need to complete, currently not implemented
    --  Look at time rollover in message handlers and timed msgs

--  J1939en - Engine CA
    --  Found references to the Engine Protection System. hmmm
        -- ok, send 65252 saying approaching shutdown
        -- wait 250ms
        -- send 65252 saying is shutdown
        -- need a system for this. (Maybe send a timed msg to ourselves.)
    --  Make sure time handling is consistant with CA, DG, ER and TC
    --  Look at time rollover in message handlers and timed msgs
    --  Find out why test testCheck_MSG02_Clean and testCheck_MSG03_Clean
        thinks that the engine should be constantly retarded

--  J1939er - Engine Retarder CA
    --  Make sure time handling is consistant with CA, DG, EN, and TC
    --  Look at time rollover in message handlers and timed msgs
    --  Figure out how to time out testCheck_TSC1_Direct_Timeout. So,
        that the proper test is performed.

--  J1939tc - Transmission CA
    --  Rebuild after editing it without backup. ugh
    --  Make sure time handling is consistant with CA, DG, EN, and ER
    --  Look at time rollover in message handlers and timed msgs

--  ???
    --  Add CAN restart routine in ???

--  J1939CA(?)
    --  Add support for large message xmt and rcv
