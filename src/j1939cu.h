/*
 * Program
 *			J1939 Control Unit (j1939cu)
 * Purpose
 *			This object provides J1939 Control Unit base object to
 *          be built upon.
 *
 *          Notes to self. The Control Units need to be able to
 *          change spn's within its CAs and force msgs to sent
 *          at specific times.  For instance, the Engine Shutdown
 *          procedure is two phases apparently given the msg,
 *          SHUTDOW. The first phase is shutdown is approaching.
 *          So, clean up all the CAs and get them ready to stop. 
 *          After an appropriate pause, the second phase is to
 *          tell everyone that they need to actually shutdown.
 *          Currently, this would be at least the following:
 *                 Set spn1109 value to approaching shutdown.
 *                 Set spn1110 value to approaching shutdown.
 *                 Issue "SHUTDOW"
 *                 wait for appropriate period.
 *                 Set spn1109 value to final shutdown.
 *                 Set spn1110 value to final shutdown.
 *                 Issue "SHUTDOW"
 *
            Maybe we run the CAM and all CAs for the CU under
            one task and run the CU under another posting control/
            response type messages (not J1939) between the two.
            Another approach would be to spawn a separate task
            for each special task and have it handle the request
            and post back when it is done.
 
            Currently, the CA can not handle multi-segment
            messages for input or output. Output is fairly
            simple using the timed message mechanism for
            output. We would need a task(??) to handle all
            multi-segment input messages since we need to
            be able to receive other messages as well and
            receive other multi-segment messages using a
            different eid that is directed to us. Of course,
            there must be limits to how much of this that
            we can do, because we need to be aware of memory
            usage for embedded processes. Maybe we have 2 or
            3 tasks with a fixed amount of memory to be 
            used for multiple purposes.
