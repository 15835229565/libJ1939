/*
 * Program
 *			Separate truck (truck)
 * Purpose
 *			This object provides a standardized way of handling
 *          a separate truck to run things without complications
 *          of interfering with the main truck. A truck may be 
 *          called a truck on other O/S's.
 *
 * Remarks
 *	1.      Things like Cylinder Heaters, Starter, Ignition and
 *          accelerator are hard wired to various truck components.
 *          For instance, the Starter is hard wired to the engine
 *          and the transmission. We provide direct access to this
 *          hard-wired entities in each of the CAs that need them
 *          in two ways. First, we provide direct methods and second,
 *          we provide Proprietary A messages that are generally
 *          issued by truck and handled in each of the components
 *          that would be normally hard-wired.
 *  2.      130,500 BTU per US gallon (36.4 MJ/L) for diesel
